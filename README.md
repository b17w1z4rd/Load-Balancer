# Load-Balancer
A simple, round-robin HTTP load balancer implemented in Go. This project forwards incoming requests to a pool of backend servers, distributing the load evenly in a round-robin fashion. Itâ€™s designed to demonstrate the basics of load balancing using Go's standard libraries for HTTP and concurrency.
